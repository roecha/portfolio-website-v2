                SpotiFaves is a web app that I developed as a final project in
                CS402: Web App Development. The project required the use of an
                online API, and I chose to use Spotify's Web API. I also needed
                to use a MongoDB database to support user login, creating and
                deleting users, admin controls, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                This application enables users to seamlessly log into their
                Spotify accounts using OAuth authentication. Once authenticated,
                it provides data regarding their music preferences
                and listening habits. Additionally, the app gives users
                the functionality to create and manage
                playlists to add to their account.

                    Homepage view of the app. Here, you can see your top songs
                    and artists from the last 4 weeks, 6 months, and all time.
                    You can also create a playlist and populate it with songs
                    from the list. Each artist and song name is clickable, and doing so will take you to a page of information about the item clicked.

                    After clicking on the name of an artist in any page, you are
                    brought to a page of information about that artist. You can
                    see their name and popularity, as well as their 10 most
                    popular songs, and each of their albums. If you click the
                    spotify button, you are brought to the artist's page on the
                    spotify app.

                    Unfortunately, I ran out of time on the project assignment
                    before I could add more information about each song
