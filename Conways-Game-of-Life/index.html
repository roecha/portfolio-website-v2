                <h2>About</h2>
                <p> John Conway's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank"><i>Game of Life</i></a> Conway's Game of Life is a simple and fascinating simulation. Imagine a grid where each cell can be alive or dead. The game progresses in steps, or "generations." In each generation, the fate of a cell is determined by its neighbors. If a live cell has too few or too many live neighbors, it dies. If a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it comes to life. The patterns that emerge can be surprisingly intricate and unpredictable, often resembling living organisms despite being just a set of rules acting on a grid. It's not a traditional game with players, but rather a captivating way to observe how simple rules can create complex behaviors.</p>
